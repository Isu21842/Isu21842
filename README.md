## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

My name is Isaias and I'm a Research Coordinator at the [Polarization and Social Change Lab](https://www.pascl.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University. I am also a Research Affiliate at the [Center for the Science of Moral Understanding](https://www.moralunderstanding.com/). Broadly speaking, my research interests are in `intergroup psychology`, `political psychology`, and `moral cognition`.
